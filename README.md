# hello-world

I, Krishna Kanth T.G, doing MS in Physics at IISER, Mohali is a computer science enthusiast. 
Whatever the new things for me in CS make me feel eager to learn, understand and apply it. Presently
it is "Diving into the world of ML and AI, ie; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence".
Per say, am sort of noob here, who is an enthusiast of ML and AI, who love to explore. Advanced Pardon :)

Committed Summer Internships at CUSAT and IIST in Machine Learning/Computer Vision.
Reading going on with a paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10955-017-1836-5
